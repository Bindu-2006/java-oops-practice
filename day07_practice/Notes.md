## Interface

- Interface is a blueprint of class.
- It contains abstract methods(by default) and constants.
- It is used to achieve 100% abstarction and multiple inheritance.
- One interface can inherit another interface using the keyword extends.

Interface → extends interface

Class → implements interface
